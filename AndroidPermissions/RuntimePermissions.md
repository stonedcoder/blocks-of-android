# Runtime Permissions

Android 6.0 Marshmallow (API 23) introduced a new runtime permission model. If your application targets Android 6.0, you must use the new permissions model.

* A permission request is made via a call to the `requestPermissions()` method of the `ActivityCompat` class.

* When this method is called, the permission request is handled asynchronously and a method named `onRequestPermissionsResult()` called when the task is completed.

* The `requestPermissions()` method takes as arguments a reference to the current activity, together with the identifier of the permission being requested and a request code.

* The request code can be any integer value and will be used to identify which request has triggered the call to the `onRequestPermissionsResult()` method.

* Modify the `MainActivity.java` file to declare a request code and request recording permission in the event that the permission check failed .

```java

package com.stonedcoder.coding-blocks.permissions;

import android.Manifest;
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;
import android.support.v4.content.ContextCompat;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import android.support.v4.app.ActivityCompat;

public class PermissionDemoActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

private static String TAG = "PermissionDemo";
private static final int RECORD_REQUEST_CODE = 101;
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
setContentView(R.layout.activity_permission_demo);

int permission = ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(this,
Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO);

if (permission != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
Log.i(TAG, "Permission to record denied");
makeRequest();
}
}

protected void makeRequest() {
ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this,
new String[]{Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO},
RECORD_REQUEST_CODE);
}
}
```

* Now implement the onRequestPermissionsResult() method.

```java

@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode,
String permissions[], int[] grantResults) {
switch (requestCode) {
case RECORD_REQUEST_CODE: {

if (grantResults.length == 0
|| grantResults[0] !=
PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {

Log.i(TAG, "Permission has been denied by user");
} else {
Log.i(TAG, "Permission has been granted by user");
}
return;
}
}
}
```

* Compile and run the app on an Android 6 device and note that a dialog seeking permission to record audio appears .

* Tap the Allow button and check that the “Permission has been granted by user” message appears in the Logcat panel.

* Once the user has granted the requested permission, the `checkSelfPermission()` method call will return a `PERMISSION_GRANTED` result on future app invocations until the user uninstalls and re-installs the app or changes the permissions for the app in Settings.
